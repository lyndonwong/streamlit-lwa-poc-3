### GOAL 

Build a variant of my streamlit-lwa-poc-1 app that connects with real local planning commission data.

WIP deployed at:
https://lwa-poc-2.streamlit.app/

### Prior Goals

1. [STILL TBD] Filter plotted project locations by traits such as "commercial project", "residential project", "mixed-use project", "estimated value < $10M", "estimated value > $10M"

2. [DONE] Show details of a plotted project on rollover (tool tip ux)

3. [DONE] Enable click through from plotted project to more details or related commission meeting minutes / transcripts.
